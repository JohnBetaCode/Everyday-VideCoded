## Sessions

### 2026-05-25 — Initial repo setup

**Goal:** Bootstrap the project structure and development environment.

**Done:**
- Created Python 3.12 dev container with `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`
- Added `devcontainer.json` so VS Code can open the repo in-container
- Created `README.md` and `docs/session-log.md`

**Decisions:**
- Used `python:3.12-slim` as the base image to keep the image light
- Created a non-root user `ada` inside the container for safer development

**Next:**
- Fill in `README.md` with project description and setup instructions
